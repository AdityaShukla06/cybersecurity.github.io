 <h2>What Is Digital Currency? </h2>
<p> A digital currency is a form of currency that is available only in digital or electronic form, and not in physical form.
It is also called digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cyber cash.Digital currencies are intangible and can only be owned and transacted in by using computers or electronic wallets which are connected to the Internet or the designated networks. In contrast, the physical currencies, like banknotes and minted coins, are tangible and transactions are possible only by their holders who have their physical ownership.


Like any standard fiat currency, digital currencies can be used to purchase goods as well as to pay for services, though they can also find restricted use among certain online communities, like gaming sites, gambling portals, or social networks.
